**syntax-pattern** is a Haskell library for parsing, analyzing, matching, and 
rewriting syntax trees using Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) and user-defined 
patterns. It is designed for research and experimentation with syntax-driven 
transformations and pattern matching in abstract syntax trees (ASTs).

## Features

- **PEG Parsing:** Define grammars using PEGs and parse input strings into syntax 
trees.
- **Pattern Language:** Express complex patterns over syntax trees, including 
variables, choices, sequences, and repetitions.
- **Pattern Matching:** Match patterns against parsed trees and capture subtrees.
- **Rewriting:** Rewrite syntax trees by applying pattern-based transformations.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Validate grammars and patterns, detect left recursion, 
duplicate rules, and other semantic errors.
- **Pretty Printing:** Human-readable output for grammars, patterns, and trees.
- **Extensible:** Modular design for easy extension and integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (>= 8.10)
- [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), or [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/)

### Building

Clone the repository and build with Cabal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/syntax-pattern.git
cd syntax-pattern
cabal build
```

Or with Stack:

```bash
stack build
```

### Usage

You can use the library in your own Haskell projects or run the provided pipelines 
for parsing, matching, and rewriting:

```haskell
import Pipeline.MatchPipeline

-- Parse and validate a PEG grammar from a string
let grammarResult = parseValidGrammar "S <- \"a\" S / \"b\""

-- Parse and validate patterns
let patternsResult = parseValidPatterns grammarString patternString

-- Parse an input file and match patterns
let matchResult = parseMatch grammarString patternString inputString
```

#### File-based Pipeline Functions

Most pipeline functions also have `IO` variants that accept file paths instead of raw 
strings. These allow you to directly specify files containing PEG grammars, patterns, 
and input data.  
You can find several example PEG, pattern, and input files in the `input/` directory 
to experiment with.

#### Tests

The `test/` directory contains property-based and sanity tests for the main algorithms
and is still in progress. 
You can use these to check the correctness and robustness of the library.

See the [Haddock documentation](docs/index.html) for detailed API usage and examples.
